MTB_project
A data analysis and visualization project using data from my mountain bike rides.
The data was created using the Strava IOS app and will be updated regularly. Though the data set is small, this project is an opportunity to practice and demonstrate my use of some important Python librararies, such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Thank you for viewing.
